We recommend the TouchOSC app to control BROBOT. This is a not a free app but is cheap and works great!
It´s available for IOS and Android.

TouchOSC has a layout editor for PC. Download and install from http://hexler.net/software/touchosc (go down to the download section)
Open the layout BROBOT.touchosc on the editor and follow the instructions to send the layout to your Smartphone/table using your wifi network.
